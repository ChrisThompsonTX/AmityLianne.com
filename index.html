                    A lot of the time we focus on what aliens might look like, or what would happen if they came to Earth. Obviously, there
                    are the Star Wars and Doctor Whos out there that show what different planets look like, but do they really show in
                    detail how an alien would live? Theoretically, aliens would have adapted to their surroundings the same way that animals
                    do; one with fur would likely come from somewhere cold, whereas one with slimy skin would probably live in a wet
                    environment. So with this in mind, we'd like you to design a habitat for an alien. (We were also NOT to show the actual
                    alien although we were allowed to show a piece of it.)

                    Pip, out of Alan Dean Foster’s Pip and Flinx adventure science fiction series, is a minidrag that came from the planet
                    of Alaspin. It is a planet with an unpleasant climate. The minidrags’ natural environment is in the Alaspin dense jungle
                    areas where there were two seasons: wet and not so wet. The minidrags themselves are described as brightly-colored,
                    leather-winged, arboreal, lethally poisonous, meter long, empathic telepathic serpentine creatures that somewhat related
                    to coelurosaurs and more than resembled flying snakes. The jungle habitats are stunningly colored environments where the
                    minidrags’ colors would blend into the brilliant tropical rainforest fauna. It was also full of other fairly lethal
                    creatures which the minidrags with their venom and flying abilities were well equipped hunt or escape from. The very
                    humid and uncomfortably warm environs are perfect for these not so warm-blooded creatures.

                    (I didn’t think I had a chance at winning anything since there was a family emergency that I had to deal with and there
                    was no time to finish this piece. It was supposed to be very brightly colored with jeweltone colors but leaving any hint
                    of the color green out. It was also supposed to have a white mist obscuring parts of the drawing. I am really grateful
                    that the judges were kind enough to vote for me.)
