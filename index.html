                    A lot of the time we focus on what aliens might look like, or what would happen if they came to Earth. Obviously, there
                    are the Star Wars and Doctor Whos out there that show what different planets look like, but do they really show in
                    detail how an alien would live? Theoretically, aliens would have adapted to their surroundings the same way that animals
                    do; one with fur would likely come from somewhere cold, whereas one with slimy skin would probably live in a wet
                    environment. So with this in mind, we'd like you to design a habitat for an alien. (We were also NOT to show the actual
                    alien although we were allowed to show a piece of it.)

                    Pip, out of Alan Dean Foster’s Pip and Flinx adventure science fiction series, is a minidrag that came from the planet
                    of Alaspin. It is a planet with an unpleasant climate. The minidrags’ natural environment is in the Alaspin dense jungle
                    areas where there were two seasons: wet and not so wet. The minidrags themselves are described as brightly-colored,
                    leather-winged, arboreal, lethally poisonous, meter long, empathic telepathic serpentine creatures that somewhat related
                    to coelurosaurs and more than resembled flying snakes. The jungle habitats are stunningly colored environments where the
                    minidrags’ colors would blend into the brilliant tropical rainforest fauna. It was also full of other fairly lethal
                    creatures which the minidrags with their venom and flying abilities were well equipped hunt or escape from. The very
                    humid and uncomfortably warm environs are perfect for these not so warm-blooded creatures.

                    Name:
                    Moulten Soulstice
                    <br>
                    M.O.M. Classification:
                    XXX (competent wizard should cope)
                    <br>
                    Habitat:
                    This creature is most likely found wading along nearly dry beds of small rills and streams in the Forbidden Forest
                    (a.k.a. Dark Forest) conveniently located near Hogwarts.
                    <br>
                    Food:
                    It is too bad that the only two Moulten Soulstice captured had proved to die within less than a upon captivity. Just a
                    little bit of fresh water and any leafage that have been exposed to at least two hours of sunshine seem to satisfy this
                    creature for upwards of two days. Observers suspect that there may be something else that these creatures consume but
                    are unable to observe the elusive creatures long enough to reach a definitive conclusion.
                    <br>
                    Facts:
                    Except for the eyes and beak, this creature is very chameleon-like with the ability to blend into fallen leaves (fresh,
                    rotting, old, new, all colors, all sizes, all shapes). The Moulten Soulstice is very aware of that weakness and will
                    draw the wings over it's face upon hearing another creature approaching. It is ,though, fascinated by the sound of
                    honest laughter that comes from a happy heart and tends to forget to keep still in search for the source of that sound.
                    Most effective in catching the attention of this creature is the laughter of a baby. It is rather skittish, though, and
                    has the ability to magically melt into the ground and move under it in order to escape capture.
                    <br>
                    Potion uses:
                    Nobody has quite understood how the use of the Moulten Soulstice "feathers" was even discovered to be useful for
                    anything (given the elusiveness of the rather rare and rather solitary creature). It has, though, been proven effective
                    in producing an amazingly tasty potion for only one use: to show the compatibility of two souls when taken exactly at
                    midnight during the summer solstice.
                    <br>
                    Notes of significance:
                    Freshly molted plumage gathered during the Winter Solstice during the first snow is the most effective for use in
                    potions. Plucked plumage not only hurts the creature greatly but makes such plumage useless for potion use.
                    Unfortunately, having the first of snow occur exactly during the advent of the Winter Solstice and actually finding such
                    plumage during that time period is very difficult indeed. Still effective but not nearly as strong are plumage molted
                    between the first snow of the season and the third snow of the season. Since the plumage resemble fallen leaves and
                    other flora detritus, it is exceptionally difficult to differentiate between a dropped plumage and a fallen leaf. There
                    is a (rather complicated) spell that can be cast to identify the fallen plumage. Said spell will make the fallen plumage
                    emit a very dim glow for about 5 seconds at a time. All in all, most potioneers find the gathering of this ingredient
                    not worth the possibility of wet frostbitten toes.

                    Captain Tusk has finally been caught, and will face pirate justice for his crimes of stealing the beautiful mermaid.
                    Unfortunately for our brave Pirate Giraffe hero, Maya the Mermaid is nowhere to be seen. No matter how much Captain
                    Longneck threatens Tusk to walk the plank, the evil elephant won't talk. How will they save his mermaid bride now? Is
                    she still safe, is she still alive?
                    <br>
                    These questions float through Longneck's mind as he ponders their next course of action. It is then that excitement
                    flows through the crew. The first mate, Tails, has finished her search of the enemies ship, and discovered an item most
                    valued. A gigantic treasure map leading to the location of Maya. Finally they will find her, and bring her home safe.
                    Your task is to create a pirate map to the location of the beautiful Mermaid. The map can be created using any form of
                    art, such as photo manipulation, drawing, graphics programs, etc. Make it as piratey as possible.

                    You don't even need some fancy pens, even just a notebook and pen will do. You can write or draw about a subject close
                    to your heart or anything random. Let your creative side shine!

                    Considering, this month’s discussion takes place on a series of islands, it seems only appropriate to have you create a
                    boat to take you to this location. You may use any medium of your choice from graphic manipulation to drawing or
                    anything else.

                    Petals, Puddles, and Pranks!
                    <br>
                    Don't students realize that the books in the Restricted Section are restricted for a reason? Not only are multiple books
                    missing without records, but the hallway leading to the most likely culprits has also been blocked off by pranksters!
                    Puddles and flowers, leaves and mud everywhere! Hopefully Madam Pince can track down those books soon before their own
                    magic adds to the mischief.

                    This is a judged graphics contest, where your objective is to depict either a storm-themed or flower-themed prank done
                    to the hallways of Hogwarts. You may create your graphic digitally or by hand, but the theme must be apparent.
